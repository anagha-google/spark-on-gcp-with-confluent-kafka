# About

This module demonstrates how to read from Kafka using the Apache Spark Kafka connector and sink to BigQuery using the Apache Spark BigQuery connector. We will first develop the code in a Spark Jupyter notebook and then convert to a script and submit from the CLI to Dataproc Serverless Spark service.
